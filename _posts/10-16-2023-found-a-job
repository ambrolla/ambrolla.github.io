Hello everyone!

In my previous post I wrote that it would be a summer miracle if I found a job. Anyway, I did find a job. Miracle did happen. It's an internship and I will be working with Python.

However, I will still be looking for opportunities until I find a full time position for myself. Also, I will still be freelancing doing front-end projects either for someone else or for myself.

My favorite tech stack so far is: Javascript, React, html + css.

So, this post was written on June 16. I thought I found a job because I've received an offer letter. However, the offer letter never stated the start date because it said that basically I need to get an NIH badge and once I'll get it, I will start working. Basically, if someone is applying for an internship position, I guess in some cases you need to wait before starting a job.

So, I'm editing a post right now, on July 17 and it's been a month since I've received an offer and still no start date. I've asked if there are any updates, there are still none. I hope I'll hear something soon!

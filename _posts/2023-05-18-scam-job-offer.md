Hello everyone!

Last week, a person commented under my post on LinkedIn that he has a job opportunity for me and then wrote me a message on LinkedIn. Screenshot of that message is below.

During our conversation, I found the job the person was referring to and asked him if that's the [job](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3601282464). The screenshot of that particular job is below. That person said yes. Last Friday (05/12/2024), we've had a zoom video interview because I wasn't sure if that job was even real or not. But the person turned out to be real and in my opinion, the interview went very well.

On Monday (05/15), around 6pm I've received the following email.

With an offer letter.

However, as I began reading the offer letter thoroughly, numerous questions started to arise in my mind. For instance, I realized that I never received a benefit booklet or any information about benefits whatsoever. Moreover, although the job position is described as hybrid in Rockville, MD, the offer letter does not clarify whether the opportunity is indeed hybrid or not. Also, other questions popped up in my head, but I'm not going to list them here unless someone is curious.

I emailed the questions to the provided email addresses in the offer letter but didn't receive any reply. After a few days, I followed up with a new email also including the person who initially messaged me on LinkedIn in that email thread. A few hours later, I received a reply on LinkedIn saying, "I'm sorry, but we're going in a different direction. Thanks for your consideration."

Confused about what happened, I began thoroughly researching the company. The first thing I found out were weird reviews on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Apexx-Strategies-EI_IE3263428.11,27.htm) that stated that the company either didn't pay them on time or at all. Also, I saw this:

I've heard of many job scams, I even wrote a [post](https://ambrolla.io/blog/post/2023/03/08/job-scam.html) about some. But I didn't think that I would experience something more than the average job scam myself. I still don't know if the company exists or not, how real was that job offer (because I only received communication through LinkedIn and no one replied to me via email), but I just wanted to warn everyone that something like this can also happen. Because with the job offer, I was also asked to fill out a lot of information including my Social Security and to be ready to provide my ID.

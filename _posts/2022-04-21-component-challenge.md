My recent challenge that I've completed at [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
Here is the [link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI) to the challenge.
This was definitely a challenge with CSS, my card component always wanted to move somewhere to the right or left, not stay in the middle.
You can view the completed challenge [here](https://ambrolla.io/Interactive-rating-component/).

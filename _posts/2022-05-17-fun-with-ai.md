This is the task I got when I applied for one of the positions. No one contacted me for an interview, but I've decided that I will still share my task.

One of the [tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7mCynsz_cBXkEaCFGSZAuvAOY84QVq35l20xJwjOYg/edit) was to write a program, like a chat-bot using API that a person could get for free (the website where you can get API is in google docs document). It was definitely a challenge for me.

You can play with chat-bot, that I've created, [here](http://ambrolla.io/fun-with-AI/)

You can see my code and Readme [here](https://github.com/Ambrolla/fun-with-AI)

Some of my screeshots:

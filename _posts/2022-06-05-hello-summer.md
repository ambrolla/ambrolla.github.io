What is your favorite season in the whole year? My favorite is summer! Usually during summer, miracles happen for me. Yes, not around Christmas time but usually during the summer. A lot of miracles that happened related with my personal life, so I will not be listing them here. However, one of the miracles that can happen would be if I find a job (and not a freelancing one). I've been looking for a job now for over 6 months. Some days, when I get one rejection after another, I get very discouraged (and I get rejected in some companies just because I lack "commercial experience"), but other days I try to make my own plan of what am I going to do over the course of the next 1-2 weeks and stick to that plan. Making my own plans and my own projects makes me busy and focused on 1 thing - coding. Also, I did some work for a startup company as a freelance UI designer. Overall, over those months since I've started looking for a job, even though I don't have a job yet, I've gained more experience than I thought that I would.

Also, I got to know more people at the local DC tech community (from DCtech slack) and I try to attend meetups that they host as often as I can. If someone is looking for Tech Meetups, those are the ones I reccomend (Alexandria coffee and code or DC code and coffee) and people there are very helpful and friendly.

What do you associate summer with? Any exciting plans? My association of summer is spending as much time as I can outside. I love beach, hiking, and last year I've relearned to love camping (I used to go camping when I was a child, but when we moved to USA, we've stopped camping trips). So, this summer, my plans are to code, look for a job (or work if I'll find a job), and have fun outside.

Hello everyone!

December was overall busy. With fully starting a job search, doing test assignments for jobs so that I could get hired without any gaps in my employement (for example, one of the tasks I did that involved Python can be found [here](https://github.com/ambrolla/python) ), and Holidays, I forgot to write anything here. Finally everything is less crazy and I'm here with the update in my life.

I'm back to the job search and I'm looking for a job very actively. I'm looking to work either with Python and something similar to what I've done at the internship (I really loved doing everything there). Or, I am happy to go back to Javascript (and my goal is to finish one of the small projects, that I've also started doing for fun maybe by the end of February if not sooner). Or I'm happy to learn something completely new, I love challenges. And what I've worked with so far either in Python or Javascript, I loved both languages, so that's why I don't have a preference, but I have more experience with Javascript than with Python.

You can find my resume in the "About me" section on this website.

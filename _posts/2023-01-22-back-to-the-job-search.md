Hello everyone!

December was overall busy. With fully starting a job search, doing test assignments for jobs so that I could get hired without any gaps in my employement (for example, one of the tasks I did that involved Python can be found [here](https://github.com/ambrolla/python) ), and Holidays, I forgot to write anything here. Finally everything is less crazy and I'm here with the update in my life.

I'm back to the job search and I'm looking for a job very actively. I'm looking for a job that's aligned with my skills. I have experience in: coordinating different projects (project management), Javascript, Python, React.js, html/css.

Also, Lately, I've been working on supporting the Code and Coffee movement! NoVa Code and Coffee is working on their website, and I'm contributing by updating their website to the latest Jekyll version, fixing some CSS as well as adding and changing website content.

In addition, I'm also working whenever I have free time, on my own project through frontendmentor.io using Javascript, React.js, html, and CSS.

You can find my resume in the "About me" section on this website.

Hello everyone!

December was overall busy. With passively starting a job search again and doing test assignments, for example, one of the tasks I did that involved Python can be found [here](https://github.com/ambrolla/python) , and Holidays, I forgot to write anything here. Finally everything is less crazy and I'm here with the update in my life.

Also, lately, I've been working on supporting the Code and Coffee movement as well as Code for DC! NoVa Code and Coffee is working on their website, and I'm contributing by updating their website to the latest Jekyll version, fixing some CSS as well as adding and changing website content.

In addition, I'm also working whenever I have free time, on my own project through frontendmentor.io using Javascript, React.js, html, and CSS.

You can find my resume in the "About me" section on this website.

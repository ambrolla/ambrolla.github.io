Hello everyone!

Remember my last post about [Coding meetups?](https://ambrolla.io/blog/post/2023/04/18/coding-meetups.html) Last month I've became an organizer for [MoCo Code and Coffee meetups!](https://www.meetup.com/mocode-coffee/) The next one will be June 25 from 1pm to 4pm near Twinbrook Metro Station in Montgomery County, MD. There are so many things that still have to be done like coordination. But I'm excited for my first Tech Meetup where I'm the organizer!

If anyone is interested in learning more, I'm always happy to answer any questions and can't wait for the actual meetup!

I've already created a channel for MoCo meetups on [DCtech Slack](https://dctech.slack.com/messages/moco-code-and-coffee/) and there is also a channel on [Discord](codeandcoffee.chat) if anyone wants to chat between meetups.

This post is mainly for me. I will be going back and clicking on the links that I've posted.

This post is for people who are self-learners and want to shape up some more what they've learned (mainly in front-end, which is where I am at). So, mainly this blog post is for someone like me and who also likes front-end.

There are so many articles on where to get the best coding practice for people who are just learning how to code. However, not all of the websites will be useful. For example, most of the websites are mainly designed to practice back-end algorithm and logic exercises. But what if someone just has or wants to do something for 20-30 minutes but not on anything that involves back-end coding. Personally, the more I code, the more I like front-end development.

Some of my top coding websites (which I've used, heard about, and some of which I might be using again) are listed below.

#### - [Frontend mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

Love it a lot. Basically each "challenge" is a plain text that is given in an html file + pictures of how the design should look like (and parts of the design are also in the file for each task). And from the test and images a person can create either just a project using html + css or an actual app (depending on how challenging the actual task is). Also, you can compete with other developers because for each task and for each feedback there is a point system (and the best developers point wise can be on their "wall of fame").

When I'll finish writing this blog post and publish (push it to github) it on my website, I will be beginning another challenge on this website.

#### - [Javscript Hero](https://www.jshero.net/en/home.html)

This source is mainly just for beginners, it is similar to freecodecamp (which will be covered a little bit later), but it has less exercises. However, it's a very good resource for people who are just beginning to learn programming and how code works. Also, there is a section with links and the first few links are for people who are just beginning to learn about coding and how it can actually work. If a person knows how to code and looks for a challenges (I personally grew out of this website), then it might not be a good source for them.

#### - [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/)

Has some react problems! And some of the challenges are free. However, only some are free (like a couple). If a person wants to have a lot of practice, then that person has to pay.

It is similar to edabit (which is talked about a little bit later), but I haven't used it as much as Edabit (because you have to pay for it). I might be checking it out more because a lot of people are still talking about it.

#### - [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

There are a lot of free problems to practice on Javascript and to shape skills on a particular topic. Definitely recommend it. But the problems are not random, they are on a particular topic. If you are looking for a lot of challenges, then the website like [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) or [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) could help more, but they are more heavy on math.

Also, you can subscribe to their letter and they have tutorials on how to make a game, or how to learn a particular language. Their tutorials are being sent weekly to an email, some of the tutorials I found very interesting!

#### - [W3Resource](https://www.w3resource.com/)

This resource is one of the good resources for the interview on a Junior position. There are also a lot of problems on a various topics. However, the reason why it's number 5 is because I don't like their editor, I don't like their way of explanation. It's a good practice, but I recommend to practice in your own editor or in codesandbox.io (one of my favorite platforms).

#### - [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges)

Actual challenges are free. But if you want to practice coding (for example do a lot of exercises), then it's not free (as an example, do a lot of exercises on a partical topic). It's a very very good resource for people who are just beginning their journey in the coding world and for people who just want to practice random problems (it's a little bit eaiser than Codewars).

Used it, loved it, wanted even to pay for it, but customer service never replied (and I couldn't pay). Will continue to use that platform for their challenges.

#### - [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard)

When I was just beginning to learn how to code, I honestly found this website a little bit challenging. Less challenging than [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), but still a little bit challenging. I actually practiced more on Edabit than here. However, the more I've learner, the less challenging this website became. Some of the people I know practice their skills on this website (I practice plain Javascript). So, I recommend it.

Ever since pandemic started, I always wondered, what would have happened if USA didn't have an average of 10-15 sick days + PTO? Could this huge number of people that are sick been prevented?

My brother, he works at the fortune 100 company as a software developer. Lately, he gave me an advice "Be ready to answer any message at almost anytime." Which surprised me. Because I know some other people working at fortune 100 companies (or not fortune 500, but very successful companies) and they are usually "Ok, it's 4:30-5pm, we are out."

Why some companies have this work-life balance and some companies don't?

I'm looking for a job, as I was saying in the previous post and my ideal job is somewhere where there would be work-life balance. But I know myself, if I want to learn something and want to succeed, I will take my time meaning that I will learn in my own free time.

Hopefully there are more jobs in USA that have this work-life balance than those, which don't.

Oh, and I know that I'm being slowly right now in uploading posts and fixing everything in a way I'd prefer, or in pushing everything to Github. Trying to maintain this work-life balance too. I spend about 1-2 hours a day just to look for a job (fill out applications and etc), then I have to answer emails from recruiters, which doesn't leave me with a lot of time to code (and I'm writing this blog post right now at 11pm).

P.S. My goal is to add comments to this website sometime soon, so hopefully I'll be receiving some replies later on.

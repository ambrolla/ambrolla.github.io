title: "Work Life Balance"

Ever since pandemic started, I always wondered, what would have happened if USA didn't have an average of 10-15 sick days + PTO? Could this huge number of people that are sick been prevented?
My brother, he works at the fortune 100 company as a software developer. Lately, he gave me an advice "Be ready to answer any message at almost anytime." Which surprised me. Because I know some other people working at fortune 100 companies (or not fortune 500, but very successful companies) and they are usually "Ok, it's 4:30-5pm, we are out."
Why some companies have this work-life balance and some companies don't?
I'm looking for a job, as I was saying in the previous post and my ideal job is somewhere where there would be work-life balance. But I know myself, if I want to learn something and want to succeed, I will take my time.

Oh, and I know that I'm being slowly right now in uploading posts and fixing everything in a way I'd prefer, or in pushing everything to Github. Trying to maintain this work-life balance too. I spend about 1-2 hours a day just to look for a job (fill out applications and etc), then I have to answer emails from recruiters, which doesn't leave me with a lot of time to code (and I'm writing this blog post right now at 11pm).

Hello everyone!

So, a miracle did happen. Only not the one I expected to happen.
I found a part-time job in a very small startup... That's not located in USA. At first, I thought that why not, I'll get an experience, it will be fun considering that it's a part-time position. One of the good things is that I get to learn Typescript, which I've never touched before joining this startups. That's why I suddenly have less commits on my github, by the way. However, I'm realizing that at this point of my career, a small startup is a challenge and not something I'm ready for yet.

So, I'm still exploring new opportunities and hoping to find a place where I would be a good fit.

P.S. One of the difficult parts that now I have is how do I also add this experience in my resume when I'm still a professional freelancer. Because it's part time and it's located in the other country, I'm still viewed as a freelancer.

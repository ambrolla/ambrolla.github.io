Hello everyone!

I understand that some of it will be written in my resume but for myself (the purpose of this blog is to write for myself as well!) I found that it would be useful to write down good things I did/learned at each position and be more thorough than in my resume.

So, my work time as an intern for this company [their website is here](qa.guru) was from July to sometime in September. I mainly worked there with Typescript (it was easy to learn since it's very similar to Javascript) as a part-time employee. Things I've learned:

1. I gained more experience and practice with Typescript as well as React.ts and that was my favorite thing that I did there!
2. I got exposed to Storybook and played a little bit with it.
3. I got exposed to Jira and ticket system.
4. The methodology that the front end team used was Scrum Methodology and I got exposed to that too.

I felt a little bit sad that my internship ended there, but it was a very interesting experience there.

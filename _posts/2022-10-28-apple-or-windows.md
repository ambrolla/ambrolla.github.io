Hello everyone!

Back in the summer my laptop broke (Asus Rog, I don't remember exactly what series type are they but it wasn't a basic laptop, it was gaming laptop). Basically, the power button stopped working properly. However, when I buy any device that costs more than $500, I always buy extra protection just in case. For Asus Rog I've had a 4-year accidental damage protection warranty and I've sent them broken laptop. Long story short, but after a while they declared that my laptop is irreparable and they've sent me the check (the price I've paid for that laptop 3 years ago). Since over the past 3 years I've started working (I can't believe that I'm actually writing this and I'm very happy that I am working and I love this job!) in IT as a developer, I've decided to actually compare and think about "What if I'll buy myself a MacbookPro, would it be worth it?" Because I have side projects (for example, I'm still playing at frontendmentor.io, but with issues with laptop, I've had to slow it down since I didn't want to do side projects on my work laptop) and I still need environment where I can develop.

When I was looking around what to buy, it turned out (in my case) that Windows laptop and Macbook Pro would cost about the same price. So, I had to do a research on what to buy and what would be best for me. I've decided to share why did I chose Windows device and not Apple, maybe it will help someone as well in their decision making process.

1. <b>Gaming.</b> I still plan on playing games on my laptop. I own Xbox X and I love it, but some games it is easier to play with steam. The person [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/u870m2/why_do_people_keep_suggesting_that_mac_is_better/) asks the same question, I've asked beforehand myself. And some games are not going to be running on MacBook.
2. <b>Insurance = money.</b> I always buy extra insurance. In Apple, even if you buy AppleCare+, you still need to pay extra if you need to do some sort of repair. "AppleCare+ for Mac extends your coverage from your AppleCare+ purchase date and includes unlimited incidents of accidental damage protection, each subject to a service fee of $99 for screen damage or external enclosure damage, or $299 for other accidental damage, plus applicable tax". When you buy Windows laptop and you buy damage protection, in most cases you don't have to pay anything afterwards. At least, I've never paid. So, if you accidentally spill coffee on Macbook = you need to pay, if on Windows - you don't have to pay. 3.<b> WSL.</b> Windows has a cool environment for coding called WSL. You can learn more about it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)
3. <b>More powerful device for the same amount of money.</b> For the price of a little upgraded MacBook Pro I bought a powerful gaming laptop.

But I still have time to change my mind because if you buy some of the things from Amazon (and I did in my case) in October - November, there is time to return some of the things until January 31 or February 1. And most of the stores other than Apple have 30 days return policy, other than Apple, which is only 14 days.

Has anyone heard of [Streamlit?](https://streamlit.io/) I haven't until I started working as a trainee. Streamlit is the library that allows us to build frontend for our machine learning and data science apps by writing all the code in Python. My last assignment, as a trainee, was to create an app using Neural Model in tensorflow and then make some additional changes to that app. One of the changes was to create a widgets so that it can change default parameters. The other change was to create a button that would shuffle images(outcome).

It was a very fun experience, which I loved, to work with the Streamlit. I would love to work more with that in the future, if there will be an opportunity to do that. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/ambrolla/examples/tree/Streamlit/streamlit_example). The example that was used is [here](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/tensorflow_v2/notebooks/3_NeuralNetworks/neural_network.ipynb)

Below are the screenshots of some of my work.

This is where you can change the default parameters.

On the bottom, there is a button where you can Shuffle the images (outcome)

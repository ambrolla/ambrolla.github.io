Hello everyone!

To be honest, this is my first time staring at the blank screen and thinking "What should I write?" since I first started writing blogs (I was 11 when I wrote my first blog entry).

Anyway, in my first blog entry I wanted to write about was IT. Because (as many of you probably know this) I'm looking for a job and one of the questions is "Why do you want to work in IT?", especially because people who interview me are probably surprised why do I want to become a developer, but who knows.

One of the reasons why I'm happy to actually know some stuff about development is that I feel proud that I can actually do something. And it makes me motivated to study more, to do more. The more I learn, the more I want to learn even more and more technologies.

I've started to learn CSS and HTML when I was about 11-12, I wanted my first blog to stand out.

I've learned SEO and touched on Jekyll when I started building and making my photography website (with help, of course).

Most of the fun happened last year, when I've realized how much you can do when you know how to code (Javascript and React.js as a framework). I'm even doing challenges on [this website](https://www.frontendmentor.io) whenever I have a free time.

So, I'm one of those people who didn't realize how fun and how interesting IT world is until I've started learning more and more about it (most of my family is in IT, so I didn't think about getting into IT because I wanted to stand out). And in the future I hope to write some piece of code at some point of my life which will make me famous (Just kidding. Or maybe not.).

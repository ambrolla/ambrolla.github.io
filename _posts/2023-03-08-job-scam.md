Hello everyone!

It's been a while since I wrote here. Wow! I'm a bit stuck with an app that I'm trying to build during my own free time. I've been busy, but this post will be more about the job search.

When you are looking for a job (either actively or passively), you encounter job scams. And those scams are not regular scams, they look very very valid! Below there will be an example of the email encounter (and this was not the only one encounter like this, I've had more than one encounter like this). However, those emails are scams and I can't understand the reasoning behind this. However, I've Googled, this company where the offer came from, doesn't exist.

There are also some other types of scams that I haven't encountered until recently. At least I understand the reasoning behind this scam. Basically, you pay $500+ or 10% from the offer and people are looking for a job for you. I feel like it's a scam because I didn't see any guarantee that they will find you a job, but who knows. If needed, I can provide a screenshot of the email encounter with those people. And those people are calling, messaging me on LinkedIn and it's hard to distiguish them from the real recruiters until you spend some time talking to them. I wish there was some place where you could report all these companies!

P.S. I'm also encountering lately an issue where you have to provide your ID or else there will not be any interview and your application will not be moving forward. Is this also a scam?

I will be adding (and probably revising) more things within April-May of 2022.

But a little bit about me:

- I'm an extravert who loves meeting new people and making friends. I'm the founder of Russian Language Speaking meetups in DC area. From 2-3 people who used to attend back in 2015 to 20-30 people who regularly attend those meetups.
- I'm a self learner in Web Development and the more I code, the more I love it. Even if there is no activity in GitHub, it doesn't mean that I don't code.
- I love coffee and cats. I have a lot of things with cats on it: front door rug, teapot, cat slippers, and an actual cat at home.
- I love reading. If I have to wait for something or someone, I will never be bored because I will always have a book somewhere nearby. I can read almost anything. However, lately I'm reading fantasy novels. One of my favorite books is <i>Witcher</i>. My book of the month was <i>Cover Story</i>.
